# Final Project

ECommerce application.

## Overview

This project consists of an ecommerce site allowing users to "purchase" products from a set of provided items controlled by an administrator.  Using this application provides an access point to shoppers who would otherwise
have to shop directly from the brick-and-mortar store.

### Usage

1. Users will Signup for an account
2. After signing up the users will be able to log into their account and view the provided list of products, account details (editable??), and past orders
3. The user will be able to add selected items to their cart
4. Once items are in the users cart the quantity can be updated or be removed altogether, and move to a "Checkout" process

### Planned Routes

1. Account Creation (POST)
2. User Login (POST)
3. Forgot Password? (POST)
